## Computer Systems Architecture
# First Assignment - Marketplace

The purpose of this assignment was to efficiently use synchronization
elements to implement a concurrent application. I have used the Lock
element to block the access for non-thread safe operations to a single
thread at a time. Some of these non-thread safe operations are addition
and subtraction.

On a lighter note, I do not find the assignment particularily useful
for the career path I would want to follow, but it was useful to learn
more about concurrence.

I consider the implementation quite efficient.
